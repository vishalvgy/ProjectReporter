# ProjectReporter
This Program takes path of a git Project and generates a json containing contribution of each author of the project to the files the author has ever contributed to, in percentage. 

By default the program checks all authors' contribution to the current branch the project is on.

By default the hidden files are checked against authors' contribution.
